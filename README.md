# Machine-Learning-Notes

This repo will host the notes of Machine Learning Specialization course by Stanford and DeepLearning AI.

I have started this Course back in 2023 and I used to study the course in a very slow phase. This is like the OG course of any modern day ML engineer. So whenever I feel like brushing the basics I will always go to this course.
